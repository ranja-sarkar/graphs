# graphs

-> from weighted graph, finding most optimal (flight) routes in terms of distance as well as airtime using Dijkstra algorithm

More on Dijkstra algorithm for a graph geodesic:

For more on graphs and how they serve as inputs to GNNs (deep learning models), please read **chapter 6** (pages 69-71) of my book "A handbook of mathematical models with python".
