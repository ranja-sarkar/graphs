There's a chapter titled "Graph Theory' dedicated to graphs and their usage, in my book 'A handbook of mathematical models with python'.
This chapter could have been named 'Graphs' or 'Networks' instead, just to imply the simplicity of its content. :)

To know about graph data structures and how they serve as inputs to GNNs (deep learning models), please read chapter 6 of the book.
